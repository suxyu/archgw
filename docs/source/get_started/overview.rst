Overview
============
`Arch <https://github.com/katanemo/arch>`_ is an AI-native proxy server and the universal data plane for AI - one that is natively designed to handle and process AI prompts, not just network traffic.

Built by contributors to the widely adopted `Envoy Proxy <https://www.envoyproxy.io/>`_, Arch helps you move faster by handling the pesky *low-level* work in AI agent development—fast input clarification, intelligent agent routing, seamless prompt-to-tool integration, and unified LLM access and observability—all without locking you into a framework.


In this documentation, you will learn how to quickly set up Arch to trigger API calls via prompts, apply prompt guardrails without writing any application-level logic,
simplify the interaction with upstream LLMs, and improve observability all while simplifying your application development process.
